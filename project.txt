### About this Project
This project is an app for a hair salon specializing in braids. It will
be developed in React using TypeScript and other tools.

Among its main features are:
- A login page for users and admin/employees of the salon.
- A register page for new users.
- A catalogue of different braids for the user to choose from, each one
will be displayed in a card with a picture, name, price and duration, as
well as a button to select the braid and start an appointment
- An appointment page where the user can schedule an appointment with one
selected braid as well as a day and hour. The user can then pay to reserve
that time for their appointment.
- A calendar to display available days and time for appointments.
- In the main page there will be a short feed of the salon's Instagram
profile's latest posts, with likes and comments count
- The contacts of the salon, including their WhatsApp and Instagram
- The location of the hair salon
- Mobile responsive design
 
Outside of the app itself, features we plan on including after the main
app is done are:
- Excel integration to build spreadsheets about monthly activity
- Automatic WhatsApp chatbot to autoschedule appointments
